## About Rocketswap

### What is Rocketswap ?

Rocketswap is a community developed AMM (Automated Market Maker) which resides on the Lamden Blockchain.

The Rocketswap application can be found [here](www.rswp.io)

### What is an Automated Market Maker ?

The Automated Market Maker is a system for exchanging assets which was popularised first by Uniswap and differs from traditional exchange systems in a few fundamental ways.

AMM's have two types of users :

#### Liquidity Providers
Liquidity Providers (LP's) earn fees by depositing liquidity (both assets of a trading pair in equal value) to a pair's liquidity pool.

#### Market Participants
Market Participants buy and sell assets in the market, their experience is identical to that of a traditional exchange user.

### The Team

We are a small team of engineers, with 40+ years of experience, committed to pushing the envelope of what is possible in the blockchain space, delivering value to the ecosystem as a whole and to our users.
We built Rocketswap to strengthen and foster a growing Lamden ecosystem. 

Rocketswap will achieve this goal by creating positive feedback loops across projects, allowing all Lamden assets to find fair market value.

### What is Lamden ?

### How can I get RSWP?
RSWP will be distributed by staking Mainnet TAU on Launch Date (8th March 2021). This staking pool will be live indefinitely.

Shortly afterwards, the RSWP/TAU LP farming pool will be opened, providing a higher RSWP reward to compensate for the unfortunate realities of impermanent loss.

### How can I get Mainnet TAU?
You can currently purchase ERC20 TAU on Uniswap or Bilaxy, and then use the token swap process to join the Lamden Mainnet.
Mainnet TAU is available at Txbit
